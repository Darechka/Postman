# Postman
This repository contains the tasks that I completed during the Software Testing course by Vadim Ksendzov.

## Homework_1
The task was to create requests with Postman and send them to the following endpoints:

__Protocol:__ http
__IP:__ 162.55.220.72
__Port:__ 5005

1. __Method:__ GET __EndPoint:__ /get_method
2. __Method:__ POST __EndPoint:__ /user_info_3
3. __Method:__ GET __EndPoint:__ /object_info_1
4. __Method:__ GET __EndPoint:__ /object_info_2
5. __Method:__ GET __EndPoint:__ /object_info_3
6. __Method:__ GET __EndPoint:__ /object_info_4
7. __Method:__ POST __EndPoint:__ /user_info_2

## Homework_2
The task was to create requests and **automated tests** with Postman and send them to the following endpoints:

__Protocol:__ http
